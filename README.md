ArcPyTweetSearch
================
*****
<b>This toolbox no longer works due to the Twitter API 1 being depreciated. Updates coming soon. Twitter now requires a set of authentication keys to be provided with each search, even for public data. Version 2 will require the input of Twitter dev keys.</b>
*****

Simple toobox that uses ArcPy, json, and urllib2 to search the twitter api using a lat, long, search string, and search radius then import to a gdb.

Included is the toolbox, python script, and the validation.py.

Inputs are all strings. Reference the Twitter API documenation for a better understanding of their restrictions:
